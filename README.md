#Intro to the Web

#Prior Knowledge
+ Intro to CSSI

#Student Objectives:
+	Explain how loading a web page in your browser works
+ Set up our learn.co and github accounts
+ Understand how to use learn.co for lesson notes and labs

#Motivation
How many times a day do you use the internet? How many times do you load a different web page? I bet you can't even begin to guess how many times in a year! In order to be a developer, and especially a web developer, it's incredibly important to understand how the web works.

#Intro to the Web
A web page is a text file written in a language that your browser (a program like Chrome or Firefox) knows how to read and turn into the page you see.  Often, it tells your browser to find other files, like pictures, that belong on the page. Sometimes it also tells the browser to find files with more code, which the browser uses to change the page. Before we talk about how we can write files that the browser can read, lets talk about where the browser gets web pages from, and how.

In talking about the internet, we use a metaphor of clients and servers - it helps us form a mental image of what is happening. Your browser is called the client, and the client makes requests of the server, to which the server responds. A server is just another computer, which your computer communicates with. Most of the requests that your browser makes are "GET" requests - your browser wants to get a page. A GET request is a request to load information. Once the server receives our request, they send back a response, which has the files needed for the page.

As you can tell, we are talking about how this happens in abstract, high-level terms. You can spend years studying the fine detail of how the internet works. After making sure we have everything set up right, we'll get started with some core internet technologies - HTML and CSS.

#Github Account
You should have received an email with instructions to setup a github account. If you haven’t done that already we will walk through it now.
Go to www.github.com and click the sign up button at the top right corner
You will be prompted to create a username, enter your address, and create a password.
The next page tells you to choose your plan and click the green “Finish sign up” button at the bottom
Finally on your dashboard click the “send verification email” button and go back to your email account to verify your email.

#Learn.co Account
Learn.co is our  learning management system which will hold all the student notes to each lesson. Each of you should have received an email that invited you to join learn.co

If you haven’t already click “Join Learn” to create an account which will bring you to a page to sign up. Use your github username and password to sign up for your learn.co account. The next page should prompt you to authorize learn.co to access your github account.
Once you are logged into learn.co you should see your dashboard. On the left is your menu panel which displays the lessons and labs for each module. The center column will display all of the notes content related to each module.

#Conclusion
Now that we know a little bit more about how the web works and we are setup with github and learn.co accounts lets jump into HTML!
