You should have received an email with instructions to setup a github account. If you haven’t done that already we will walk through it now.
Go to www.github.com and click the sign up button at the top right corner
You will be prompted to create a username, enter your address, and create a password.
The next page tells you to choose your plan and click the green “Finish sign up” button at the bottom
Finally on your dashboard click the “send verification email” button and go back to your email account to verify your email.

#Learn.co Account
Learn.co is our  learning management system which will hold all the student notes to each lesson. Each of you should have received an email that invited you to join learn.co

If you haven’t already click “Join Learn” to create an account which will bring you to a page to sign up. Use your github username and password to sign up for your learn.co account. The next page should prompt you to authorize learn.co to access your github account.
Once you are logged into learn.co you should see your dashboard. On the left is your menu panel which displays the lessons and labs for each module. The center column will display all of the notes content related to each module.
